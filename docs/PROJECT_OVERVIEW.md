-   **PostgreSQL**: Relational database with advanced features
-   **Row Level Security**: Database-level access control
-   **Real-time Subscriptions**: Live data updates capability
-   **File Storage**: Organized image storage with CDN delivery

### State Management

-   **Server Actions**: Next.js server-side data mutations
-   **React Hooks**: Local state management with optimized re-renders
-   **FormData**: Efficient file upload handling
-   **Caching**: Next.js automatic caching with manual revalidation

## Key Implementation Decisions

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Form Optimization**: Separated form state from non-form state to prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. **Image Handling**: Sequential upload processing to prevent server overload
3. **Component Structure**: Proper separation of concerns between UI and business logic
4. **Database Queries**: Optimized queries with proper indexing and relationships

### Security Measures

1. **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with secure session management
2. **Authorization**: User-owned data with RLS policies
3. **File Upload**: Type validation and organized storage structure
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly messages

### User Experience Design

1. **Mobile-First**: Responsive design starting from mobile viewports
2. **Loading States**: Comprehensive loading indicators for async operations
3. **Error Feedback**: Clear error messages with actionable guidance
4. **Intuitive Navigation**: Logical flow between different app sections

## Database Schema Design

### Core Tables

```sql
Property {
  id: UUID (Primary Key)
  user_id: UUID (Foreign Key to auth.users)
  listing_title: TEXT
  address: TEXT
  city: TEXT
  property_type_id: INTEGER (Foreign Key)
  price: NUMERIC
  bedrooms: INTEGER
  bathrooms: INTEGER
  rate: INTEGER (1-5)
  description: TEXT
  created_at: TIMESTAMPTZ
}

PropertyImage {
  id: UUID (Primary Key)
  property_id: UUID (Foreign Key)
  image_url: TEXT
}

PropertyType {
  id: SERIAL (Primary Key)
  name: TEXT UNIQUE
}
```

### Relationships

-   **One-to-Many**: Property → PropertyImage
-   **Many-to-One**: Property → PropertyType
-   **One-to-Many**: User → Property

### Security Policies

-   Users can only access their own properties
-   Public read access for lookup tables
-   Image access tied to property ownership

## File Organization Strategy

### Component Architecture

```
components/
├── ui/                    # Base shadcn/ui components
├── forms/                 # Form-specific components
├── dashboard/             # Dashboard-related components
├── auth/                  # Authentication components
└── shared/                # Reusable utility components
```

### Server Actions Structure

```
app/actions/
├── property-actions.ts    # Property CRUD operations
├── auth-actions.ts        # Authentication operations
└── storage-actions.ts     # File upload operations
```

### Route Organization

```
app/
├── (auth)/               # Authentication routes group
├── (dashboard)/          # Main application routes
├── (onboarding)/         # Onboarding flow routes
└── api/                  # API routes (if needed)
```

## Image Upload System

### Storage Strategy

-   **Organization**: Files stored in `property-images/{propertyId}/` folders
-   **Naming**: Timestamp + random string to prevent conflicts
-   **Processing**: Sequential upload with error handling
-   **Cleanup**: Automatic deletion when properties are removed

### Upload Flow

1. **Client**: File selection with validation
2. **Form**: FormData creation with files
3. **Server**: Property creation + image upload
4. **Storage**: File upload to Supabase Storage
5. **Database**: URL storage in PropertyImage table
6. **Cleanup**: Rollback on failure

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality

-   **TypeScript**: Strict type checking enabled
-   **ESLint**: Code linting with Next.js recommended rules
-   **Prettier**: Code formatting (if configured)
-   **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit validation (if configured)

### Testing Strategy

-   **Unit Tests**: Component and utility function testing
-   **Integration Tests**: API and database operation testing
-   **E2E Tests**: Critical user flow testing
-   **Manual Testing**: Cross-browser and device testing

### Deployment
